# HTMLDSL

## What's a DSL:
It stands for Domain Specific Language.  
Purpose: DSL solves a particular problem for everyone even for the ones with very little knowledge on a particular domain.  
If you are an Apple Developer, then you would probably know about `Podfile` which is a DSL written in Ruby.
